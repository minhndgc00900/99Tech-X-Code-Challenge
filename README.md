# 🧠 Coding Challenges Repository

This repository contains solutions to a series of coding problems. Each problem is housed in its own folder and demonstrates different React or TypeScript techniques — from algorithms to UI design.

Below is a preview of the problems, as seen in the project interface:

## 📂 Problems Overview

### 🧮 Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n
A basic algorithm challenge that explores three different approaches to summing numbers from `1` to `n`:
- Iterative
- Recursive
- Mathematical formula

Good for benchmarking and performance comparison.

---

### 🍭 Problem 2: Fancy Form
An interactive, validated form built using a modern frontend stack:
- ✅ **React**
- ✅ **TypeScript**
- ⚡ **Vite**
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**
- 🧩 **Ant Design**

Includes custom validation messages and polished UI/UX using `react-hook-form`, `yup`, and `antd` notification system.

---

### 🤢 Problem 3: Messy React
A "worst practices" playground. This intentionally messy React component is designed for:
- Debugging practice
- Performance tuning
- Refactor exercises
